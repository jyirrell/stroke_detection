# stroke_detection
Stroke detection challenge from Kaggle, original info can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

While the original challenge required participants to  submit their predictions from the data within test csv, I completed this outside of the challenge and so used the train csv as the entire dataset, creating a train test split for data on which to train, test and score the model
